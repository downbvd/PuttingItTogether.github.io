    <p>Question Answers:</p>
    <p>1. I chose to be a pro tennis player because there is good pay, and I enjoy the sport of tennis.</p>
    <p>2. I would describe this career as difficult, however, players can get 500 thousand USD to 10 million USD yearly, which makes up for the difficulty.</p
    <p>3. To be successful in this career, you need to have good genetics. You need to be at least 6 ft tall. You also need to have fast feet. Plus, you must train daily.</p>

    <p class="indented">4. A typical day in the life in this career looks like this: waking up, eating a healthy breakfast with protein, getting your bag ready, training for around two hours, come back, strech, rest, eat, and go out and train for another two hours. Finally, eat, stretch, and go to sleep.</p>
